#### Dotfiles

* These are my personal dotfiles.
* They currently support Ubuntu or Fedora distros at least insofar as package managers are concerned.
* There are probably a efw bugs, LSD, and Alacritty install hasn't been tested thoroughly.

#### TODO:

- Get `xow` to compile.
- Fix Docker key warning.
- Add other manually compiled tools.
- Move `firefox-developer` install location to user's home dir `~/Apps` or `~/.local/`
